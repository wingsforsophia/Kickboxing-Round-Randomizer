# Kickboxing-Round-Randomizer

### Background

This is something I have been thinking about making since I started coding in May. That's also when me and two of my friends bought huge kickboxing bags and doing Zoom workouts together, trying to replicate our success working out together in our kickboxing studio even though we all live in different places now. Through several iterations we have honed our workouts, and this is the only thing that has been missing. We have been recycling the same 43 sets of 6 rounds for 7 months now, so this will at least take these and randomize them into something new for us.
